  🔭 Breaking into cybersecurity one CTF at a time. <br><br>
  👯 Looking to collaborate on penetration testing, threat detection, and cloud security projects.<br><br>
  🌱 Working on intrusion detection systems, AWS monitoring, and spending way too much time with Burp Suite and DVWA.<br><br>
  💬 Ask me about pentesting, SOC operations, or how I won those CTFs.<br><br>
  ⚡ Always learning. Always caffeinated. If there's a bug, there's a fix—just need to find it.
